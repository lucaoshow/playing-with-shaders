# Playing with shaders!

<div align="justify">

&emsp;Hi! I made this repository to store my shader codes and experiments. It's a technology I've been studying and dreaming about working with and getting better at. I create sections on this README file for each new project I add to this repository, so I can document my progress and introduce the content to anyone who's interested. Hope you enjoy!

&emsp;**Important Disclaimer:** I'm a begginer! I have some programming experience, but graphics and shaders are very complex and I've just started getting deep into it. So if you're reading this, maybe saw something interesting here and want to get in contact to give me some feedback, to teach me some techniques or just to talk and learn together, feel free to [send me an email](mailto:lnunes718business@gmail.com) or get in touch via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-nogueira-nunes/). I would absolutely love that!


## First project: outlines!

&emsp;It's not really my first contact with shaders, but it's the first project I'm documenting here. Long story short, it's about an outline effect I made for a game in a game jam that didn't go forward... But at least I got to keep the source code! Basically it's a transition to a pixelated black and white visual effect with customizable outlines. It's not complex or anything like that, but it's worth a look! Check it out [here](./playing-with-outlines/).
